2. accompilsh 1.

the syntax of the language:

```

#there are times statement

# {times} times


```
```
# example

# will print:
hello from "jet"
hello from "jet"
hello from "jet"

```

```
print " == language test == "
(5) {print 10}
```
will be:
```
print 10
print 10
print 10
print 10
print 10
```
and the result:
```
 == language test == 
10
10
